# React-Boilerplate

This is my React boilerplate repository. Very useful for starting React projects quickly without having
to go through the hassle of writing a lot of boilerplate and installing manually a bunch of libraries.

This project was created with `create-react-app`, so it comes with Jest already configured as the default
testing framework. I'm also using Cypress for end-to-end testing.

This project already has React-Router configured, together with Redux and Redux-Thunk.
